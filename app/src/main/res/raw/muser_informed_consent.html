	Researchers at the University of South Florida (USF) study many topics. To do this, we need the
	help of people who agree to take part in research studies. The person in charge of this research
	study is Dr. Hongdao Meng, Director of the Positive Aging Lab and Associate Professor in the
	School of Aging Studies at the University of South Florida.

<h2>
	Purpose of the Study
</h2>
<p align="left">
	<a name="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a>
	This is a unique opportunity to pilot test a music app designed to promote music engagement
	among persons with dementia and their caregivers. The purpose of this study is to gauge the
	feasibility and acceptability of the MUSER app for home use. The study should also measure
	whether music listening helps reduce agitation among persons living with dementia.
</p>
<h2>
	<strong>How do I participate?</strong>
</h2>
<p align="left">
	You will be asked to answer questions regarding the music preferences of the person you are
	caring for, as well as yourself. You will then be asked to use an Android tablet preloaded with
	the MUSER app and a diverse collection of music. Next, you will be asked to use the app to
	listen to music for two weeks. Following this testing period, you will be asked to complete an
	exit survey and an interview about your experience using the app and the effect on the person
	living with dementia.

	To participate in this study, tap the "'Agree" button at the bottom of this form. By tapping
	the “Agree” button, I freely give my consent to take part in this study. I understand that by
	proceeding with this survey that I agree to take part in research, and I am 18 years of age
	or older.
